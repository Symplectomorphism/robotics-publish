# Application: Inertial Navigation

## Inertial navigation system {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="77%"}

* INS estimates:
  - velocity, orientation, and position by 
  - measuring accelerations and angular velocities and integrating them over
    time.
* No external inputs such as radio signals from satellites needed.
  - Well-suited for submarines, spacecraft and missile guidance.
* During cold war and space race, these systems were large, extremely expensive
and technical details national secrets.

* Today, INSs are considerably cheaper and smaller.
  - They are built into every smart phone!

* An INS estimates its pose w.r.t. an inertial reference frame which is
typically denoted $\{0\}$ and fixed to some point on Earth.
  - Common conventions: north-east-down (NED) or east-north-up (ENU).

* The coordinate frame $\{B\}$ is attached to the moving vehicle or robot and is
known as the body- or body-fixed frame.

## Gyroscopes {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Measures the rate-of-change of orientation.
* Fix the gyroscope to the vehicle in the strapdown configuration as shown in
the figure below.
  - If the vehicle rotates with an angular velocity $\bm{\omega}$, the attached
    gyroscope will _resist_ and exert an orthogonal torque $\bm{\tau}$,
    which can be measured:
    $$ \bm{\tau} = \bm{\omega} \times \bm{h} = \bm{\omega} \times \bm{J}\bm{\omega}.$$
  - If the magnitude of $\bm{h}$ is high, then this kind of sensor is very
    sensitive -- a very small angular velocity leads to an easily measureable
    torque.
* Low-cost sensors used in mobile phones and drones are based on
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) fabricated on silicon chips.
* Three gyroscopes are packaged together and arranged so that their sensitive
axes are orthogonal.
* The three outputs of such a triaxial gyroscope are the components of the
angular velocity vector ${^B}\bm{\omega}^\sharp$.

## Estimating orientation {.smaller}

&nbsp;

* _Nature_ has invented gyrocopic sensors.
* All vertebrates have angular velocity sensors as part of their vestibular systems.
  - In each inner ear we have three semi-circular canals: fluid-filled organs
    that measure angular velocity.
  - Arranged orthogonally, just like a triaxial gyroscope, with two measurement
    axes in a vertical plane and one diagonally across the head.

* If we assume that ${^B}\bm{\omega}$ is constant over a time interval
$\delta_t$, the equivalent rotation at time step $k$ is 
$$ {^B}\xi_\Delta \langle k \rangle \sim
e^{{^B}\hat{\bm{\omega}}^\sharp \delta_t}. $$

* If the orientation of the sensor frame is initially $\xi_B$, then the
evolution of estimated pose can be written in discrete-time form as
$$ \xi_B\langle k+1 \rangle \leftarrow \xi_B \langle k \rangle \oplus
{^B}\xi_\Delta \langle k \rangle. $$



## Accelerometers {.smaller}

* Even when not moving they sense the acceleration due to gravity, defining the
direction we know as _downward_.

* Gravitational acceleration can be approximated by 
$$ g \approx 9.780327 \left( 1 + 0.0053024 \sin^2{\theta} - 0.0000058
\sin^2{2\theta} \right) - 0.000003086h, $$
where $\theta$ is the angle of latitude and $h$ is the height above sea level.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
* An accelerometer comprises a proof mass, supported by a spring.
$$ m \ddot{x}_m = F_s - mg = kd - mg $$
* The various displacements are related by: $\;\; x_b - \left(l_0 + d \right) = x_m$.
  - $l_0$: spring's natural length, $d$: its extension.
* Taking double derivatives and substituting gives
$$ \ddot{x}_b - \ddot{d} = \frac{1}{m}\left(kd-mg\right).$$
* Assuming $\ddot{d} \approx 0$, we wish to measure the acceleration of the
accelerometer $a = \ddot{x}_b$:
$$ d = \frac{m}{k}\left(a + g \right) \;\; \Longrightarrow \;\; a^\sharp = a + g =
\frac{kd}{m}. $$

## Accelerometers {.smaller}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
A stationary accelerometer indicates an upward acceleration of $1$g.

* This may be counterintuitive since the accelerometer is clearly stationary --
if anything, the acceleration should be in the downward direction.
* However, the reality is that an accelerometer at rest in a gravity field
reports upward acceleration.
:::

* Accelerometers measure acceleration along a single axis.
  - Typically three accelerometers are packaged together and arranged so that
    their sensitive axes are orthogonal.
  - The three outputs of such a triaxial accelerometer are the components of the
    acceleration vector ${^B}\bm{a}^\sharp$ measured in the body frame $\{B\}$.

* _Nature_ has also invented the accelerometer.
  - All vertebrates have acceleration sensors called ampullae as part of the
    vestibular system.
  - We have two in each ear: the saccule measures vertical acceleration, and the
    utricle measures front-to-back acceleration. They help us maintain balance.
  - The proof mass in the ampullae is a collection of calcium carbonate cyrstals
    called otoliths. Hair cells embedded in a gelatinous substrate measure the
    displacement of the otoliths due to acceleration.


## <span style="font-size: 90%">Estimating pose and body acceleration</span> {.smaller}

* In frame $\{0\}$ with its $z$-axis vertically upward, the gravitational
acceleration is $\;{^0}\bm{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & g \end{pmatrix}^\top$.
* In a body-fixed frame $\{B\}$ at an arbitrary orientation, in terms
of the roll-pitch-yaw angles $${^0}\xi_B =
\bm{R}_{z,\theta_y}\bm{R}_{y,\theta_p}\bm{R}_{x,\theta_r} $$
the gravitational acceleration will be
$${^B}\bm{a} = \left(\ominus {^0}\xi_B\right) \bullet {^0}\bm{a} =
\begin{pmatrix}
-g \sin{\theta_p} \\
g \cos{\theta_p} \sin{\theta_r} \\
g \cos{\theta_p} \cos{\theta_r}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
* Equating this to the _measured_ acceleration vector ${^B}\bm{a}^\sharp =
\begin{pmatrix} a_x & a_y & a_z \end{pmatrix}^\top$, we obtain
$$
\sin{\hat{\theta}_p} = -\frac{a_x}{g}, \quad \tan{\hat{\theta}_r} =
\frac{a_y}{a_z}, \;\; \theta_p \neq \pm \frac{\pi}{2}.
$$

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
We have made a very strong assumption that the measured acceleration
${^B}\bm{a}^\sharp$ is only due to gravity. On a robot the sensor will
experience additional acceleration as the vehicle moves and this will introduce
an error in the estimated orientation.
:::



## <span style="font-size: 90%">Estimating pose and body acceleration</span> {.smaller}

* Frequently, we want to estimate the motion of the vehicle in the inertial
frame, and the total measured acceleration in $\{0\}$ is due to gravity _and_
motion $${^0}\bm{a}^\sharp = {^0}\bm{g} + {^0}\bm{a}_v $$

* We observe acc. in the body frame so the vehicle acceleration in the
world frame is $${^0}\hat{\bm{a}}_v = {^0}\hat{\bm{R}}_B \, {^B}\bm{a}^\sharp -
{^0}\bm{g} $$ and we assume that ${^0}\hat{\bm{R}}_B$ and $\bm{g}$ are both
known[^2]. Integrating that w.r.t. time
$$ {^0}\hat{\bm{v}}_v(t) = \int {^0}\hat{\bm{a}}_v(t) \, \text{d}t $$ gives the
velocity of the vehicle, and integrating again
$$ {^0}\hat{\bm{p}}_v(t) = \int {^0}\hat{\bm{v}}_v(t) \, \text{d}t $$ gives its
position.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
* We can assume vehicle acceleration is zero and estimate attitude, or
assume attitude and estimate vehicle acceleration.
* We cannot estimate both since there are more unknowns than measurements.
:::

[^2]: The first is a strong assumption. Any error in ${^0}\hat{\bm{R}}$ results in
incorrect cancellation of the gravity component of $\bm{a}^\sharp$ leading to an
error in the estimated body acceleration.


## Magnetometers {.smaller}

&nbsp;

* The Earth is a massive but weak magnet. 
  - At any point on the planet, the magnetic flux lines can be considered a
    vector $\bm{m}$.
  - Its magnitude and direction can be accurately predicted and mapped.
* The direction is described by two angled: declination and inclination.
  - A horizontal projection of $\bm{m}$ points in the direction of magnetic
    north and the declination angle $D$ is measured from true north clockwise to
    that projection.
  - The inlination angle $I$ of the vector is measured in a vertical plane
    downward from horizontal to $\bm{m}$.
* The length of the vector, the magnetic field intensity, is measured bya
magnetometer in units of Tesla (T).
  - For the Earth this varies from $25-65$ $\mu$T, 
  - By comparison a modern MRI machine has a magnetic field strength of $4-8$T.


## How magnetometers work {.smaller}

&nbsp;

:::{.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Hall-effect sensor
A semiconductor device which produces a voltage
proportional to the magnetic field intensity in a direction normal to the
current flow.

* Three of them are packaged together and arranged so that their sensitive axes
are orthogonal.

* The three outputs of such a triaxial magnetometer are the components of the
Earth's magnetic field intensity vector ${^B}\bm{m}^\sharp$, measured in the
body frame $\{B\}$.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Nature
* Creatures from bacteria to turtles and birds are known to sense magnetic fields.
* The effect is particularly well-known in pigeons and there is debate about
whether or not humans have this sense. 
* The actual biological sensing mechanism
has not yet been discovered.
:::


## Estimating heading {.smaller}

* Consider an inertial coordinate frame $\{0\}$ with its $z-$axis vertically
upward and its $x-$axis pointing toward _magnetic_ north. $$ {^0}\bm{m} = B
\begin{pmatrix} \cos{I} & 0 & \sin{I} \end{pmatrix}^\top $$ where $B$ is the
magnetic field intensity and $I$ is the inclination angle (both are known).
* In a body-fixed frame $\{B\}$ at an arbitrary orientation in terms of
roll-pitch-yaw angles $${^0}\xi_B =
\bm{R}_{z,\theta_y}\bm{R}_{y,\theta_p}\bm{R}_{x,\theta_r}$$ the magnetic field
intensity will be $$ {^B}\bm{m} = \left(\ominus {^0}\xi_B\right) \bullet
{^0}\bm{m}.$$
* Equating this to the _measured_ magnetic intensity field vector
${^B}\bm{m}^\sharp = \begin{pmatrix} m_x & m_y & m_z \end{pmatrix}^\top$ yields
an estimate of the yaw angle
$$ \hat{\theta}_y = \arctan{\frac{\cos{\theta_p}\left(m_z \sin{\theta_r} - m_y
\cos{\theta_r}\right)}{m_x + B \sin{I}
\sin{\theta_p}}} $$ assuming the roll and pitch angles have been determined,
perhaps using measured acceleration.
* To obtain the heading angle w.r.t. to the true-north, we subtract the local
declination angle: ${^{tn}}\hat{\theta}_y = \hat{\theta}_y - D$.


## Sensor fusion {.smaller}

* <span style="font-size: 97%">The collection of inertial sensors is referred to as an inertial measurement
unit (IMU).</span>
  - A 6-DoF IMU comprises triaxial gyroscopes and accelerometers.
  - A 9-DoF IMU additionally comprises triaxial magnetometers.
  - A 10-DoF IMU may add altitude measurement through a barometric pressure
    sensor.
* The sensors we use, particularly the low-cost ones in phones and drones, are
far from perfect.
  - For any sensor value -- gyroscope, accelerometer or magnetometer -- the
    measured signal $$ x^\sharp = sx + b + \varepsilon $$ is related to the true
    value $x$ by a scale factor $s$, bias $b$ and random noise $\varepsilon$.
  - $s$ is usually specified by the manufacturer to some tolerance, say $\pm
    1\%$, and for a particular sensor this can be determined by some calibration
    process.
  - Bias $b$ is ideally equal to zero but will vary from device to device. Bias
    that varies over time is often called _sensor drift_. Both the scale factor
    and the bias are typically functions of temperature.
* In practice, bias is the biggest problem because it varies with time and
temperature and has a very deleterious effect on the estimated pose and
position.

## Sensor fusion {.smaller}

* Sensor bias is problematic!
  - A rule of thumb is that gyroscopes with bias stability of $0.01$ deg/h will
    lead to position error growing at a rate of $1.85$ km/h.
* A simple approach to this problem is to estimate bias by leaving the IMU
stationary for a few seconds and computing the average value of all sensors.
  - This value is then subtracted from future sensor readings.
  - This is really only valid over a short time period because the bias is not
    constant.
* A more sophisticated approach is to estimate the bias online!
  - We need to combine information from different sensors for this -- _sensor
    fusion_.
  - We rely on the fact that different sensors have complementary
    characteristics.
* Bias on angular rate sensors causes the attitude estimate error to grow with
time.
  - Accelerometers respond to motion of the vehicle while good gyroscopes do
    not.
  - Magnetometers provide partial information about roll, pitch and yaw, are
    immute to acceleration.
* There are many ways to achieve this kind of fusion -- we will later see how
Kalman filters do this. Here we will consider a simple, but still very effective
alternative.


## <span style="font-size: 90%">Explicit complementary (Mahony) filter</span> {.smaller}

* In a later chapter, we will see why the complementary filter works in theory.
For now, let us simply change the rotation update step from earlier to the following.
$$ {^B}\xi_\Delta \langle k \rangle = e^{\left({^B}\hat{\bm{\omega}}^\sharp\langle k
\rangle - \hat{\bm{b}}_e\langle k \rangle + k_p \hat{\bm{\sigma}}_R \langle k
\rangle\right)\delta_t}. $$

* The key differences are that the estimated bias $\bm{b}_e$ is subtracted from
the sensor measurement and a term based on the orientation error $\bm{\sigma}_R$
is added.
  - The estimated bias changes with time according to $$ \bm{b}_e \langle
    k+1 \rangle \leftarrow \bm{b}_e \langle k \rangle - k_I \bm{\sigma}_R \langle k
    \rangle $$ and also depends on the orientation error $\bm{\sigma}_R$.
  - $k_p, k_I > 0$ are both well chosen constants.
  - The orientation error is derived from $N$ _vector measurements_
    ${^0}\bm{v}_i^\sharp$: $$ \bm{\sigma}_R \langle k+1 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N
    k_i \, {^0}\bm{v}_i \times {^0}\bm{v}_i^\sharp \langle k \rangle. $$ where
    ${^0}\bm{v}_i$ is the known value of a vector signal in the inertial frame
    (e.g. graviational acceleration) and $$ {^0}\bm{v}_i^\sharp \langle k
    \rangle = {^0}\hat{\xi}_B \langle k \rangle \bullet {^B}\bm{v}^\sharp
    \langle k \rangle. $$ is the value measured int he body-fixed frame and
    rotated into the inertial frame by the estimated orientation
    ${^0}\hat{\xi}_B$.

* Any error in direction between these vectors will yield a nonzero
cross-product which is the axis around which to rotate one vector into the
other.

* The filter uses this difference -- the _innovation_ -- to improve the
orientation estimate by feeding it back to the rotation update.

* The filter allows an unlimited number of vectorial measurements ${^0}\bm{v}_i$
to be fused together: e.g. we could add magnetic field or any other kind of
direction data such as altitude and azimuth of visual landmarks, stars or
planets.
