# Localization and Mapping

## Simultaneous localization and mapping {.smaller}

* Feels like a ''chicken and egg'' problem
  - we need a map to localize and
  - we need to localize to make a map.
* However, based on what we have learned so far this problem is now quite
straightforward to solve.

* The state vector comprises the vehicle configuration _and_ the coordinates of
the $M$ landmarks that have been observed so far $$ \hat{\bm{x}} =
\left(x_v, y_v, \theta_v, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, \ldots, x_M, y_M \right)^\top \in
\mathbb{R}^{2M+3 \times 1} $$

* The estimated covariance is a $(2M+3) \times (2M+3)$ matrix and has the
structure $$ \hat{\bm{P}} = \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\bm{P}}_{vv} &
\hat{\bm{P}}_{vm} \\ \hat{\bm{P}}_{vm}^\top & \hat{\bm{P}}_{mm} \end{pmatrix} $$ 
where $\hat{\bm{P}}_{vv}$ is the covariance of the vehicle pose,
$\hat{\bm{P}}_{mm}$ the covariance of the map landmark positions, and
$\hat{\bm{P}}_{vm}$ is the correlation between vehicle landmark states.


## SLAM {.smaller}


* The predicted vehicle state and covariances are as they were given in
localization section with perfect map knowledge.

* When a new feature is observed the state vector is updated using the insertion
Jacobian $\bm{Y}_z$ but in this case $\bm{G}_x$ is nonzero
$$ \bm{G}_x = \frac{\partial \bm{g}}{\partial \bm{x}} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & -r \sin{\left(\theta_v + \beta\right)} \\
0 & 1 & r \cos{\left(\theta_v + \beta\right)} \end{pmatrix} $$ since the 
estimate of the new landmark depends on the state vector which now contains the 
vehicle's pose.

* For SLAM, the Jacobian $\bm{H}_x$ describes how the landmark observation
changes w.r.t. the state vector. The observation will depend on the position of
the vehicle and on the position of the observed landmark $$ \bm{H}_x =
\frac{\partial \bm{h}}{\partial \bm{x}}\vert_{w=0} = \begin{pmatrix}
\bm{H}_{x_v} & \cdots & 0 & \cdots & \bm{H}_{p_i} & \cdots & 0 \end{pmatrix} \in
\mathbb{R}^{2 \times \left(2M+3\right)}. $$

* Now, the Kalman gain matrix $\bm{K}$ _distributes_ innovation from the
landmark observation, a $2$-vector, to update _every_ element of the state vector
-- the pose of the vehicle _and_ the position of _every_ landmark in the map.

## SLAM -- covariance
The final covariance matrix is shown graphically on the right. The landmark
uncertainties never increase. 

The position prediction model is that they do not move, but they also never drop
below the initial uncertainty of the vehicle.

* The correlations are used by the Kalman filter to connect the observation of
any landmark to an improvement in the estimate of every other landmark in the
map as well as the vehicle pose. It is as if all the states were connected by
springs.
