* GPS makes outdoor localization easy; unfortunately GPS is far from perfect.
  - relies on very weak radio signals received from distant orbiting satellites.
  - GPS cannot work where there is no _line of sight_ radio reception.
* GPS has only been in use since 1995 yet humankind has been navigating the
planet and localizing for many thousands of years!
* _Dead reckoning_ is the estimation of location based on estimated speed,
direction and time of travel w.r.t. a previous estimate.

* Given average compass heading over the previous hour and a distance traveled
the position at $3$ p.m. can be found using elementary geometry from the
position at $2$ p.m.
  - Measurements on which the update is based are subject to both systematic and
    random error.
  - Modern instruments are quite precise but 500 years ago clocks, compasses and
    speed measurements were primitive.

* Estimates are recursive: each estimate is based on the previous one.
  - errors will accumulate over time
  - for sea voyages of many-years this approach was quite inadequate!
* The Phonecians were navigating at sea more than $4,000$ years ago and they did
not even have a compass!

* They navigated with crude dead reckoning but wherever possible they used
_additional information_ to correct their position estimate.
  - sightings of islands and headlands
  - primitive maps and observations of the Sun and the Pole Star.

* A landmark is a visible feature in the environment whose location is known
w.r.t. some coordinate frame.
  - A precise bearing measurement to two landmarks will therefore pinpoint our
    location, a process known as _resectioning_.

* This process is critically reliant on correctly associating the observed
landmark with the feature on the map.
  - Mistaking one lighthouse for another, e.g. $\bm{C}$ for $\bm{B}$ leads to
    significant error in estimated position ($\bm{q}$ instead of $\bm{p}$).
* This is a very common error and countless ships have foundered because of this
fundamental data association error.
  - This is why lighthouses flash with a _unique_ flashing pattern!

## Localization Problem
Find an estimate $\hat{\bm{x}}$ of the true, but unknown position, $\bm{x}$ of 
the robot. We also wish to know the _uncertainty_ of the estimate (standard
deviation associated with the position estimate $\hat{\bm{x}}$).
:::

* It is useful to describe a robot's estimated position in terms of a probability 
density function over all possible positions of the robot.
  - allows for multiple hypotheses about the robot's position.
