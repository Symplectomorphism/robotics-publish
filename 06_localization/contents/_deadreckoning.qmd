# Dead Reckoning

## Dead reckoning {.smaller}

* An odometer is a sensor that measures distance traveled and sometimes also
change in heading direction.
  - For wheeled devices, can be determined by measuring the angular
    rotation of the wheels.
  - Direction of travel can be measured using a compass or 
  - Change in heading can be measured using a gyroscope.
* These sensors are imperfect due to systematic errors
  - incorrect wheel radius,
  - gyroscope bias
* They are also imperfect due to random errors such as slip between wheels and
the ground.
* Robots w/o wheels, such as aerial and underwater robots, can use visual 
odometry based on observations of the world moving past the robot.


## Modeling the vehicle {.smaller}

* The first step in estimating the robot's pose is to write a function,
$\bm{f}(\cdot)$, that describes how the vehicle's configuration changes from one
time step to the next.
* The initial pose is represented in $\bm{SE}(2)$ as 
$$
\xi\langle k \rangle \sim
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} & -\sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} & x\langle k
\rangle \\ 
\sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} & \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} & y\langle k
\rangle \\ 
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
* Move forward in the vehicle $x$-direction by $\delta_d$ and then rotate by
$\delta_\theta$ giving the new configuration
$$
\begin{aligned}
\xi\langle k \rangle &\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} & -\sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} & x\langle k
\rangle \\ 
\sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} & \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} & y\langle k
\rangle \\ 
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & \delta_d \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\delta_\theta} & -\sin{\delta_\theta} & 0 \\
\sin{\delta_\theta} & \cos{\delta_\theta} & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \\ 
&\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\left(\theta \langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta\right)} &
-\sin{\left(\theta\langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta\right)} & 
x\langle k \rangle + \delta_d \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
\sin{\left(\theta \langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta\right)} &
\cos{\left(\theta\langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta\right)} & 
y\langle k \rangle + \delta_d \sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Modeling the vehicle {.smaller}

* Let's represent this succinctly as a $3$-vector $\bm{x} = (x, y, \theta)$ so
that
$$
\bm{x}\langle k+1 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix}
x\langle k \rangle + \delta_d \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
y\langle k \rangle + \delta_d \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
\theta\langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta
\end{pmatrix}
$$
which gives the new configuration in terms of the previous configuration and the
odometry.
* Odometry is not perfect and we model the error by imagining a random number
generator $(v_d, v_\theta)$ that corrupts the output of a perfect odometer
(_sensor noise_).

## Robot's configuration at the next time step, including odometry error
$$
\bm{x}\langle k+1 \rangle = \bm{f}\left( \bm{x}\langle k \rangle, \delta \langle
k \rangle, \bm{v}\langle k \rangle \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
x\langle k \rangle + (\delta_d+v_d) \cos{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
y\langle k \rangle + (\delta_d+v_d) \sin{\theta\langle k \rangle} \\
\theta\langle k \rangle + \delta_\theta + v_\theta
\end{pmatrix}
$$
:::

* We typically model the odometry noise as $\bm{v} = \left(v_d,
v_\theta\right)^\top \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \bm{V})$, a zero-mean multivariate
Gaussian, with variance $\bm{V} = \text{diag}\left\{\sigma_d^2, \sigma_\theta^2
\right\}$.

## Ship's navigator problem
How to estimate our new pose given the previous pose and noise odometry?
:::
* The mathematical tool that we will use is the _Kalman filter_.
  - provides the optimal estimate of the system state assuming zero-mean
    Gaussian noise.
* The filter is a recursive algorithm that updates, at each time step, the
optimal estimate of the unknown true configuration and the uncertainty
associated with that estimate.
* The Kalman filter is formulated for linear systems but our model of the
vehicle's motion is nonlinear, so we'll use the extended Kalman filter (EKF).
* For this problem, the state vector is the vehicle's configuration $$ \bm{x} =
\left(x_v, y_v, \theta_v \right) $$ and the prediction equations 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bm{x}}^+\langle k+1 \rangle &= \bm{f}\left(\hat{\bm{x}}\langle k \rangle,
\hat{\bm{u}}\langle k \rangle \right) \\
\hat{\bm{P}}^+\langle k+1 \rangle &= \bm{F}_x\hat{\bm{P}}\langle k
\rangle \bm{F}_x^\top + \bm{F}_v \hat{\bm{V}}\bm{F}_v^\top
\end{aligned}
$$
describe how the state and covariance evolve with time.


## Estimating pose {.smaller}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\bm{x}}^+\langle k+1 \rangle &= \bm{f}\left(\hat{\bm{x}}\langle k \rangle,
\hat{\bm{u}}\langle k \rangle \right) \\
\hat{\bm{P}}^+\langle k+1 \rangle &= \bm{F}_x\hat{\bm{P}}\langle k
\rangle \bm{F}_x^\top + \bm{F}_v \hat{\bm{V}}\bm{F}_v^\top
\end{aligned}
$$

* $\hat{\bm{u}}\langle k \rangle$: input to the process; in this case is the
measured odometry, so $\hat{\bm{u}}\langle k \rangle = \delta \langle k \rangle$.
* $\hat{\bm{P}} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ is a covariance matrix representing
the uncertainty in the estimated vehicle configuration.
* $\hat{\bm{V}}$ is our estimate of the covariance of the odometry noise, which
in reality, we do not know.
* $\bm{F}_x$ and $\bm{F}_v$ are Jacobian matrices obtained by differentiating
the equations of motion and evaluating the result at $\bm{v} = 0$, giving
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bm{F}_x &= \frac{\partial \bm{f}}{\partial \bm{x}}\vert_{\bm{v}=0} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & -\delta_d \sin{\theta_v} \\ 0 & 1 & \delta_d \cos{\theta_v} \\ 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \\
\bm{F}_v &= \frac{\partial \bm{f}}{\partial \bm{v}}\vert_{\bm{v}=0} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta_v} & 0 \\ \sin{\theta_v} & 0 \\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$
which are functions of the current state and odometry.

* The true (_blue_) and estimated (_red_) robot path is shown in the figure to
the right.
  - $95\%$ confidence ellipses are indicated in green. 
  - That is there is $95\%$ chance that the robot's $x$- and $y$-coordinate is 
  within $\pm 2\sigma$ bound.
* There are off-diagonal terms in the correlation matrix, which indicate that
the uncertainties between the corresponding variables are related.
  - For example, the value $P_{1,3}=P_{3,1} = -0.5575$ indicates the
    uncertainties in $x$ and $\theta$ are related.
* The total uncertainty is given by $\sqrt{\det{(\hat{\bm{P}})}}$ and is
plotted.
  - It never decreases because RHS of the $\hat{\bm{P}}$ eqn. is positive definite.
  - Means that $\bm{P}$, the position uncertainty can never decrease!
