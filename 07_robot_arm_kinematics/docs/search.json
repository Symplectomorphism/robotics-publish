    "text": "Inverse position: a geometric approach\n\nMost six-DoF manipulator designs are kinematically simple rendering the geometric approach simple and effective.\n\nIt is partly due to the difficulty of the general inverse kinematics problem that manipulator designs have evolved to their present state.\n\nThe complexity of the inverse kinematics problem increases with the number of nonzero DH parameters.\n\nFor most manipulators, many of the aia_i, did_i are zero, the αi\\alpha_i are 00 or ±π2\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, etc.\nIn these cases especially, a geometric approach is simplest and most natural.\n\nThe general idea of the geometric approach is to solve for the joint variable qiq_i by projecting the manipulator onto the 𝐱i−1−𝐲i−1\\bm{x}_{i-1}-\\bm{y}_{i-1} plane and solving a simple trigonometry problem.\n\nFor example, to solve for θ1\\theta_1, we project the arm onto the 𝐱0\\bm{x}_0-𝐲0\\bm{y}_0 plane and use trigonometry to find θ1\\theta_1.\nWe will illustrate this method with two important examples: the spherical (RRP) and the articulated (RRR) arms."
