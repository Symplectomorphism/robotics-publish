# Forward Kinematics

## Kinematic chains {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

* A robot manipulator is composed of a set of links connected together by
joints.
  - Simple: revolute or prismatic with one degree-of-freedom (DoF)
  - Complex: universal or spherical with multiple DoF

* No loss of generality considering only single DoF joints as multiple DoF
joints can always be thought of as a succession of single DoF joints with links
of length zero in between.

* The action of each joint can be described by a _single real number_:
  - the angle of rotation in the case of a revolute joint
  - the displacement in the case of a prismatic joint

* A robot manipulator with $n$ joints will have $n+1$ links, since each joint
connects two links.

* Number the joints from $1$ to $n$ and the links from $0$ to $n$, starting from
the base.

* Joint $i$, which is fixed w.r.t. link $i-1$, connects link $i-1$ to link $i$.

* When joint $i$ is actuated, link $i$ moves (hence, link $0$ is fixed).

* With the $i^{\text{th}}$ joint, we associate a __joint variable__, denoted by
$q_i$. 

$$
q_i = \begin{cases}
    \theta_i & \mbox{if joint $i$ is revolute} \\
    d_i & \mbox{if joint $i$ is prismatic} \\
\end{cases}
$$

* We attach a coordinate frame rigidly to each link; i.e. $\Sigma_i$ is attached
to link $i$.
  - the coordinates of each point on link $i$ are constant when expressed in
    $\Sigma_i$
  - $\Sigma_0$ is attached to the robot base, is referred to as the __base
    frame__, __inertial frame__, or __world frame__.

* Suppose $\bm{A}_i$ is the homogeneous transformation matrix that gives the pose of
$\Sigma_i$ w.r.t. $\Sigma_{i-1}$.
  - The assumption that all joints are either revolute or prismatic means that 

  $$ \bm{A}_i = \bm{A}_i(q_i). $$

* The homogeneous transformation matrix that expresses the pose of $\Sigma_j$
w.r.t. $\Sigma_i$ is called a __transformation matrix__, and is denoted 
${^i}\bm{T}_j$.

&nbsp;

* We denote the pose of the end-effector w.r.t. the inertial frame by a
$3$-vector ${^0}\bm{o}_n$ and the rotation matrix ${^0}\bm{R}_n$ and define the homogeneous
transformation matrix
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
$$
{^i}\bm{T}_j = \begin{cases}
    \bm{A}_{i+1}\bm{A}_{i+2}\cdots \bm{A}_{j-1}\bm{A}_j & \mbox{if } i < j\\
    I & \mbox{if } i = j \\
    \left( {^j}\bm{T}_i \right)^{-1} & \mbox{if } j > i
\end{cases}
$$

 $$ \bm{H} = \begin{pmatrix} {^0}\bm{R}_n & {^0}\bm{o}_n \\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}. $$

:::

::::

* The pose of the end-effector in the inertial frame are is thus given by the
product $$ \bm{H} = {^0}\bm{T}_n = \bm{A}_1(q_1) \bm{A}_2(q_2) \cdots \bm{A}_n(q_n). $$

* Each homogeneous transformation $\bm{A}_i$ is of the form
$$ \bm{A}_i = \begin{pmatrix} {^{i-1}}\bm{R}_i & {^{i-1}}\bm{o}_i \\ 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}. $$

* Hence, for $i < j$, $$ {^i}\bm{T}_j = \bm{A}_{i+1} \cdots \bm{A}_{j} = 
\begin{pmatrix} {^i}\bm{R}_j & {^i}\bm{o}_j \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. $$


## Kinematic chains {.smaller}

* The matrix ${^i}\bm{R}_j$ expresses the orientation of $\Sigma_j$ relative to 
$\Sigma_i$ and is given by the rotational part of the $\bm{A}$ matrices as 

$$ {^i}\bm{R}_j = {^i}\bm{R}_{i+1} {^{i+1}}\bm{R}_{i+2} \cdots {^{j-1}}\bm{R}_j.
$$

* The coordinate vectors ${^i}\bm{o}_j$ are given recursively by the formula 

$$ {^i}\bm{o}_j = {^i}\bm{o}_{j-1} + {^i}\bm{R}_{j-1}{^{j-1}}\bm{o}_j. $$

* In principle, this is all there is to forward kinematics:
  - Determine the functions $\bm{A}(q_i)$,
  - Multiply them together as needed.

* The Denavit-Hartenberg convention streamlines and simplifies this procedure.


## Denavit-Hartenberg convention {.smaller}

* It is possible to carry out forward kinematic analysis even without respecting
the _Denavit-Hartenberg_ or _DH_ convention.

* However, the kinematic analysis of an $n$-link manipulator can be extremely
complex and the conventions introduced below simplify the analysis considerably.

In the DH convention, each homogeneous transformation $\bm{A}_i$ is
represented as a product of four basic transformations where the four quantities
$\theta_i$, $a_i$, $d_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are parameters associated with link $i$
and joint $i$.

    \mathcal{R}_{z,\theta_i}\mathcal{T}_{z,d_i}\mathcal{T}_{x,a_i}\mathcal{R}_{x,\alpha_i} \\
    &= \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{\theta_i} & -s_{\theta_i}c_{\alpha_i} & s_{\theta_i}s_{\alpha_i} & a_ic_{\theta_i} \\

* Recall: the matrix $\bm{A}_i$ is a function of a single variable.
  - Three of the above four quantities are constant for a given link,
  - The fourth parameter, $\theta_i$ for a revolute joint and $d_i$ for a
    prismatic joint, is the joint variable.


## Number of parameters {.smaller}

* When we discussed rigid-body motion, we learned that an arbitrary homogeneous
transformation matrix can be characterized by $6$ numbers: $3$ for rotation,
$3$ for translation.

* In the DH representation, there are only four parameters: how is this
possible?
  - Answer: While frame $i$ is required to be rigidly attached to link $i$, we
    have considerable freedom in choosing the origin and the coordinate axes of
    the frame.
  - By a clever choice of the origin and the coordinate axes, it is possible to
    cut down the number of parameters needed from $6$ to $4$.

## Assigning the coordinate frames {.smaller}

* One can always choose the frames $\Sigma_0, \ldots, \Sigma_n$ in such a way
that (DH1) and (DH2) are satisfied.
* Sometimes, this will require placing the origin $o_i$ of $\Sigma_i$ in a
location that may not be intuitively satisfying.
* The choices of the coordinate frames are _not_ unique!
  - However, the end result, i.e. the matrix ${^0}\bm{T}_n$, will be the same!
    (assuming the choice of $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma_n$ coincide for the two
    different coordinate frame placements.)
* The choice of $\bm{z}_i$ is _arbitrary_: __First__, we assign the axes
$\bm{z}_0, \ldots, \bm{z}_{n-1}$ in an intuitively pleasing fashion: assign 
$\bm{z}_i$ to be the axis of actuation for joint $i+1$.
  - if joint $i+1$ is revolute, $\bm{z}_i$ is the axis of revolution of joint
    $i+1$;
  - if joint $i+1$ is prismatic, $\bm{z}_i$ is the axis of translation of joint
    $i+1$.
* __Second__ we establish the base frame. This is nearly arbitrary.
  - Choose $o_0$ to be any point on $\bm{z}_0$.
  - Choose $\bm{x}_0$, $\bm{y}_0$ in any convenient manner so long as $\Sigma_0$
    is right-handed.
* __Third__, we begin an iterative process in which we define $\Sigma_i$ using
frame $\Sigma_{i-1}$ beginning with $\Sigma_i$. Three cases to consider: (i)
$\bm{z}_{i-1}$ and $\bm{z}_i$ are not coplanar, (ii) $\bm{z}_{i-1} \parallel
\bm{z}_i$, (iii) $\bm{z}_{i-1} \pitchfork \bm{z}_i$.

## $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ and $\bm{z}_i$ are not coplanar
* There exists a unique shortest line segment from $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ to $\bm{z}_i$
perpendicular to both $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ to $\bm{z}_i$.
* This line segment defines $\bm{x}_i$ and the point where it intersects
$\bm{z}_i$ is the origin $o_i$.
* Choose an axis $\bm{y}_i$ to form a right-handed frame.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## $\bm{z}_{i-1} \parallel \bm{z}_i$ ($\bm{z}_{i-1}$ is parallel to $\bm{z}_i$, therefore $\alpha_i = 0$)
* There are infinitely many common normals between $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ and
$\bm{z}_i$.
* We are free to choose the origin $o_i$ at any convenient point on the
$\bm{z}_i$-axis.
* The axis $\bm{x}_i$ is chosen either to be directed from $o_i$ to
$\bm{z}_{i-1}$ along the common normal, or as the opposite to this vector.
* Common method: choose the normal that passes through $o_{i-1}$ as the
$\bm{x}_i$-axis; $o_i$ is then the point at which this normal intersects
$\bm{z}_i$ &nbsp; $\therefore d_i = 0$.

* To complete the construction, it is necessary to specify $\Sigma_n$.
* $\Sigma_n$ is commonly referred to as the __end effector__ or __tool frame__.
* $o_n$ is most often placed symmetrically between the fingers of the gripper.
* The unit vectors along $\bm{x}_n$, $\bm{y}_n$, and $\bm{z}_n$ are labelled as 
$\bm{n}$ (normal), $\bm{s}$ (sliding), and $\bm{a}$ (approach), respectively.


## Summary of the DH procedure {.smaller}

Step 1. &nbsp; Locate and label the joint axes: $\bm{z}_0, \bm{z}_1, \ldots,
\bm{z}_{n-1}$.  

Step 2. &nbsp; Establish the base frame: set the origin anywhere along the
$\bm{z}_0$ axis. Choose $\bm{x}_0$ and $\bm{y}_0$ conveniently to form a
right-handed frame.

&nbsp; &nbsp; For $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$, perform steps $3$ to $5$.

Step 3. &nbsp; Locate the origin $o_i$ where the common normal to $\bm{z}_i$ and
$\bm{z}_{i-1}$ intersect $\bm{z}_i$. If $\bm{z}_i \pitchfork \bm{z}_{i-1}$,
locate $o_i$ at this intersection. If $\bm{z}_i \parallel \bm{z}_{i-1}$, locate
$o_i$ at any convenient position along $\bm{z}_i$.


Step 4. &nbsp; Establish $\bm{x}_i$ along the common normal between
$\bm{z}_{i-1}$ and $\bm{z}_i$ through $o_i$, or in the direction normal to the
$\bm{z}_{i-1}-\bm{z}_i$ plane if $\bm{z}_{i-1} \pitchfork \bm{z}_i$.


Step 5. &nbsp; Establish the $\bm{y}_i$ to complete a right-handed frame.

Step 6. &nbsp; Establish $\Sigma_n$:

> If the $n^{\text{th}}$ joint is revolute, set $\bm{z}_n = \bm{a}$
> parallel to $\bm{z}_{n-1}$. Establish the origin $o_n$ conveniently along
> $\bm{z}_n$, preferably at the center of the gripper or at the tip of any tool
> that manipulator may be carrying. Set $\bm{y}_n = \bm{s}$ in the direction of 
> the gripper closure, and set $\bm{x}_n = \bm{n} = \bm{s} \times \bm{a}$. If
> the tool is not a simple gripper, set $\bm{x}_n$ and $\bm{y}_n$ conveniently
> to form a right-handed frame.


## Summary of the DH procedure {.smaller}

Step 7. &nbsp; Create a table of DH parameters $a_i$, $d_i$, $\alpha_i$,
$\theta_i$:

* $a_i$: distance along $\bm{x}_i$ from the axis $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ to the axis
$\bm{z}_i$.
* $d_i$: distance along $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ from $o_{i-1}$ to the intersection of the
$\bm{x}_i$ and $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ axes. If joints $i$ is prismatic, $d_i$ is a
variable.
* $\alpha_i$: the angle from $\bm{z}_{i-1}$ to $\bm{z}_i$ measured about
$\bm{x}_i$.
* $\theta_i$: the angle from $\bm{x}_{i-1}$ to $\bm{x}_i$ measured about
$\bm{z}_{i-1}$. If joint $i$ is revolute, $\theta_i$ is a variable.

Step 8. &nbsp; Form the homogeneous transformation matrices $\bm{A}_i$ by
substituting the above parameters into 
$$
\bm{A}_i =
\mathcal{R}_{z,\theta_i}\mathcal{T}_{z,d_i}\mathcal{T}_{x,a_i}\mathcal{R}_{x,\alpha_i}
$$

Step 9. &nbsp; Form ${^0}\bm{T}_n = \bm{A}_1 \bm{A}_2 \cdots \bm{A}_n$. This
gives the pose of the tool frame expressed in the base coordinates.

* The joint axes $\bm{z}_0$ and $\bm{z}_1$ are normal to the page.
* Establish the base frame $\Sigma_0$ by choosing the origin at the point of
intersection of the $\bm{z}_0$-axis with the page and the $\bm{x}_0$-axis in
the horizontal direction.
* $o_1$ is located at the intersection of $\bm{z}_1$ and the page. $\bm{x}_1$ is
the opposite of the vector directed from $o_1$ to $\bm{z}_0$.
* The final frame $\Sigma_2$ is fixed by choosing $o_2$ at the end of link $2$.

$$
\bm{A}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
c_1 & -s_1 & 0 & a_1c_1 \\ s_1 & c_1 & 0 & a_1s_1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0

## Example 6: SCARA manipulator {.smaller}

::: {.column width="65%"}
* All joint axes are parallel so we have some freedom in the placement of the
origins: placed as shown for convenience.
* Establish the $\bm{x}_0$ axis in the plane of the page.
  - This choice is arbitrary, but does determine the __home position__ of the
    manipulator.
  - This is the position of the manipulator when the joint variables are all
    zero.
