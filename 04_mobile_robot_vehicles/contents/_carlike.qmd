* A commonly used model for the low-speed behavior of a four-wheeled car-like 
vehicle is the kinematic bicycle model.
* The velocity of each wheel is in the plane of the wheel and the wheel rolls
without slipping sideways: $$ {^B}\bm{v} = (v, 0). $$
* The _configuration_ of the vehicle is represented by the generalized
coordinates $\bm{q} = (x, y, \theta) \in \mathcal{C} = \mathbb{R}^2 \times
\mathbb{S}^1$.
* The dashed lines show the direction along which the wheels cannot move; these
lines of no motion intersect at the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR).
* The angular velocity is $$ \dot{\theta} = \frac{v}{R_B}, $$ and by simple
geometry the turning radius is $R_B = \frac{L}{\tan \gamma}$, where $L$ is the
length of the vehicle or _wheel base_.

## Bicycle model of a car
The car is shown in _light gray_ and the bicycle approximation is _dark gray_.
The steering wheel angle is $\gamma$ and the velocity of the back 
wheel in the $x$-direction, is $v$. The two wheel axes are extended as dashed 
lines and intersect at the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) and the
distance from the ICR to the back and front wheels is $R_B$ and $R_F$,
respectively.

* For a fixed steering wheel angle, the car moves along a circular arc.
* The velocity of the robot in the world frame is $(v \cos{\theta}, v
\sin{\theta})$ so the equations of motion are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &= v \cos{\theta}, \\
\dot{y} &= v \sin{\theta}, \\
\dot{\theta} &= \frac{v}{L} \tan{\gamma}.
\end{aligned}
$$

## Characteristics of a car-like vehicle
* When $v=0$ then $\dot{\theta} = 0$; i.e., it is not possible to change the
vehicle's orientation when it is stationary.
* In the world-coordinate frame, the velocity must satisfy an algebraic
equality: $$ \dot{y}\cos{\theta} - \dot{x}\sin{\theta} \equiv 0, $$
called a _nonholonomic constraint_. This equation cannot be integrated to form a
_holonomic constraint_, i.e., a relationship between $x$, $y$, and $\theta$.
