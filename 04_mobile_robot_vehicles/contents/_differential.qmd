* Differential steering steers by independently controlling the speed of the
wheels on each side of the vehicle -- if the speeds are not equal the vehicle
will turn.
* The vehicle's velocity is by definition $v$ in the vehicle's $x$-direction,
and zero in the $y$-direction since the wheels cannot slip sideways: $$
{^B}\bm{v} = (v, 0). $$
* The configuration of the vehicle is represented by the generalized coordinates
$\bm{q} = (x, y, \theta) \in \mathcal{C} = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$.
* The vehicle follows a curved path centered on ICR.
* The left-hand wheels move at a speed of $v_L$ along an arc with a radius $R_L$
while the right-hand wheels move at a speed of $v_R$ along an arc with a radius
of $R_R$. The angular velocity is
$$
\dot{\theta} = \frac{v_L}{R_L} = \frac{v_R}{R_R} = \frac{v_R - v_L}{W},
$$
since $R_R = R_L + W$, with $W$ denoting the wheel separation.

## Differential drive robot
The robot is shown in _light gray_ and the unicycle approximation in _dark
gray_. The vehicle follows a path around the ICP and the distance from the ICR
to the left and right wheels is $R_L$ and $R_R$, respectively. We can use the
alternative body frame $\left\{B^\prime\right\}$ for trajectory tracking control.

* The equations of motion are therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &= v \cos{\theta}, \\
\dot{y} &= v \sin{\theta}, \\
\dot{\theta} &= \frac{v_\Delta}{W},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $v = \frac{1}{2}\left(v_R+v_L\right)$ and $v_\Delta = v_R - v_L$ are the
average and differential velocities, respectively.
* For a desired speed $v$ and turn rate $\dot{\theta}$ we can solve for $v_R$
and $v_L$. This kinematic model is often called the _unicycle model_.
* Similar to the car-like vehicle, this model has a _nonholonomic constraint_ as
well: $$ \dot{y} \cos{\theta} - \dot{x} \sin{\theta} = 0. $$
* If we move the vehicle's reference frame to $\left\{B^\prime\right\}$ and
ignore orientation, we can rewrite the EoM as
$$
\begin{pmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} \cos{\theta} & -a \sin{\theta} \\ \sin{\theta} & a \cos{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} v \\ \omega \end{pmatrix}.
$$
(To be solved for desired $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{y}$.)
